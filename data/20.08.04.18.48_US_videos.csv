Sponsored by eBay Motors, download the app here! - https://ebayvehicle.com/app/engexplainedSubscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7I went shopping for an Acura NSX. I found one from 1992 in red; it was absolutely gorgeous, low miles, and had a two-owner clean history. I went for a test drive, and that's where things fell apart. I had in my head how legendary of a car this was, but it unfortunately didn't live up to my expectations. Don't get me wrong, the NSX is quite good. The shifting is absolutely perfect, the torque curve genuinely impressed me for a relatively low powered engine, and the handling was without a doubt quite solid. However the steering and the braking left a lot to be desired, which I was shocked by, considering the manual steering rack. Perhaps I just caught a lemon, but left a bitter taste that turned me away from the car. So to my true love I went, and I absolutely love it. Check out the video for the full breakdown!

I trust myself (I trust). I can be confident just by believing in myself.The title track “Oh my god” started from having a theme of “self-trust.” It is an Urban Hiphop track in which the stark differences in rhythm that correspond to the atmospheric changes within the song stand out. The fantasy-like mood and the bold sound led by a vintage piano sound and an 808bass are impressive. This track is something only (G)I-DLE can perform.(여자)아이들((G)I-DLE) 미니3집 [I trust]Release on 2020.04.06. 18:00 (KST)(G)I-DLE Official YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/gidleofficial(G)I-DLE Official Twitter: https://twitter.com/G_I_DLE(G)I-DLE Official Facebook: https://facebook.com/G.I.DLE.CUBE(G)I-DLE Official Instagram: https://instagram.com/official_g_i_dle(G)I-DLE Official Fansite: http://cafe.daum.net/cube-g-i-dle(G)I-DLE Official Weibo: http://weibo.com/cubegidleⓒ All Rights Reserved CUBE Entertainment Inc.#여자아이들 #GIDLE #Ohmygod"

After troubleshooting the ignition and fuel systems that plagued our last test session, we finally got to rip across the water at 90 mph and there's plenty of speed left in this beast once we get the air/fuel mixture tuned perfectly and stop the turbos from trying to melt the fiberglass boat hull. This video has lots of tips about troubleshooting V8 engines and it ends with us having the time of our lives in Game Over, our twin-turbo jet boat. Note: I live at the lake and nobody was near me when we tested the jet boat. We are staying away from people just like you are, I just happen to be fortunate enough to live in a rural part of Georgia. Anyway, thanks for watching and for liking and commenting on this video. We'll be back soon with another one!If you'd like more information about the ultrasonic parts washer that we used on the spark plugs in this video then go here: https://ultrasonicllc.com/machines/ultra-1300mGame Over is a 2017 Peterson Placecraft fiberglass Jet Boat hullIt's powered by an aluminum 711ci Sonny Leonard Hemi with twin Precision 88mm turbochargers. It features CP pistons, Carrillo connecting rods and a Bullet camshaft. T&D shaft rockers and Manley valves and springs are in the heads. The engine and boat is wired completely using Wirecare.com and Techflex products. It runs on 118 octane Rockett Brand racing fuel. The efi is from Holley, the ignition is MSD and the jet drive is a Dominator pump built by B1 Racing. I welded the headers from a kit by Stainlessheaders.com. -Finnegan"
